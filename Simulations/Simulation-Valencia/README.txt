This simulation was written for a demo, and as such, it is a bit specific. It
is similar to the Glasgow scenario, but the map is set in Valencia, at around

During the demo, we had devices connected to their context, and so each step 
pauses the simulation to allow showing the terminals to the public. Check the
SimulationSteps enum in Constants for details on the demo script.
