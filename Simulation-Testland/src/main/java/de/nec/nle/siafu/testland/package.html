A very simple test simulation, used to try out the simulator and
further develop it. It comprises a labirynth-like map where agents
wander around zombie style. Three agents are special, however: Teresa
and Pietro stay put for the user to control, and the Postman runs errand
from point A to B. Tirelessly.
