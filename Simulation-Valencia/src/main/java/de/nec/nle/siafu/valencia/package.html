<p>This simulation was written for a demo, and as such, it is a bit
specific. It is similar to the Glasgow scenario, but the map is set in
Valencia, at around the time of the America's cup. There's two users,
Pietro and Teresa, who go through a series of steps involving meeting at
the cinema and going for dinner. During the demo, we had devices
connected to their context, and so each step pauses the simulation to
allow showing the terminals to the pubilc. Check the SimulationSteps enum
in Constants for details on the demo script.</p>
