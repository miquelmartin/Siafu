<p>Simulation of a Medical Campus in Glasgow. While not being as big
as a city, this is a good example of outdoors simulation. The behavior
is pretty vanilla, with agents going in an out of buildings (gaussian
distributed traffic) and two users, Andy and Ralf, standing by for
commands. This is one example of demo simulation, where you can bind
your applications to the context of Ralf or Andy, and show your
application change according to their actions.</p>
