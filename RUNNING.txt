What now?
==============================
So, you just downloaded this zip file from http://siafusimulator.org or
cloned it from https://github.com/miquelmartin/Siafu
Great. Now what? :)

0. Pre-requisites
==============================
In order to compile Siafu, you will need a Java Virtual Machine, such as 
Oracle's:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

As well as a running installation of maven, which you'll find here:
http://maven.apache.org/

1. Compiling Siafu
==============================
To compile Siafu, get onto the top folder (Where this file is located),
and simply run 

	mvn package

If that gives you trouble, make sure mvn is in your PATH and that 
JAVA_HOME is defined (more info at http://maven.apache.org/)

2. Running Siafu
==============================
Once you've compiled Siafu (with mvn package), simply go to the target
folder, where you'll find a Siafu-<version_number>. In there, there are
scripts to run Siafu for each supported platform.

3. First steps
==============================
In the same folder where the compiled Siafu is, you will find also
a collection of example simulations. Try one out!

- Start Siafu using the batch script for your platform
- Go to the "Simulation" menu, then "Open Packed Simulation"
- Locate and load a simulation in the "simulations" folder where you
  compiled Siafu (e.g. Simulation-Leimen-<version>.jar
 
Have fun! Make sure to read the tutorial to get you started creating
your own simulation. You'll find it here:
